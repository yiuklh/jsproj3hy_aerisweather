Date: July 2016

This is an introductory JavaScript learning project @hackeryou.

Project 3 focus on utilizing an API (Application Program Interface) to create a simple front-end interactive user interfaces. In this case, coding my first weather webmap (interactive map)! However, the primary learning objective emphasizes to retrieve sample codes from an documentation (often available in the API's GitHub website), and lookup relevance resources to problem-solves and troubleshootings.  

In this project, I have chosen the "Intro to Aeris.js beta Weather Map" as my topic. Which I will walkthrough an introductory tutorial to setup a basic weather webmap using JavaScript. 

Pre-requisite: 
Learners should have an exisiting basics Leaflet.js webmap setup.

After my difficulties navigating available resources from documentations, which they were often explained in technical manners and can't comprehend as a complete beginner learner (some codes were even outdated and thus no longer work when attempted to tryout). I decided to compile a much easier tutorial targeting for the beginners, which it shows in simpler steps with hyperlinks only to those updated info they may want to know or lookup from.
