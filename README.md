This is an introductory JavaScript, jQuery learning project @hackeryou.

Project 3 focus on developing something that is appropriate to my current beginner proficiency. Yet being creatively challenging to create a simple front-end interactive user interfaces that is doable within the short project timeframe. Perhaps considering an API (Application Program Interface) too! 

However, my primary objectives emphasize learning how to retrieve sample codes from an API documentation, and lookup relevance resources to problem-solves and troubleshootings.  

In this project, I have chosen the "Intro to Aeris.js beta Weather Map" as my topic. Which I will walkthrough an introductory tutorial to setup a basic weather webmap using JavaScript. Which means I had programmed my first (ever) weather webmap/interactive online map!  

Pre-requisites: 
- Learners should have an exisiting basics Leaflet.js webmap setup. 
< http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html >
- Basic proficiency with JavaScript, HTML, CSS

After my difficulties had setup an Aeris.js weather map. I decided to compile an easier tutorial targeting for the beginners, whom they may also encounter similar learning challenges.
