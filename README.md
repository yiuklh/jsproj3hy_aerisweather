Date: July 2016

This is an introductory JavaScript learning project @hackeryou.

Project 3 focus on utilizing an API (Application Program Interface) to create a simple front-end interactive user interfaces. In this case, coding my first weather webmap (interactive map)! However, the primary learning objective emphasizes to retrieve sample codes from an documentation (often available in the API's GitHub website), and lookup relevance resources to problem-solves and troubleshootings.  

In this project, I have chosen the "Intro to Aeris.js beta Weather Map" as my topic. Which I will walkthrough an introductory tutorial to setup a basic weather webmap using JavaScript. 

Pre-requisite: 
Learners should have an exisiting basics Leaflet.js webmap setup.

After my difficulties looked-up resources from available documentations, which they were often explained in technical manners and usually can't comprehend as a complete beginner learner (some codes were even outdated and thus no longer work when tried the codes). I decided to compile a much easier and updated tutorial targeting for the beginners, which it explains in much simpler steps with hyperlinks only to the info they may need to know and continue learning to build upon from.
