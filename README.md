Date: Summer 2016

This is an introductory JavaScript learning project @hackeryou.

Project 3 focus on utilizing an API (Application Program Interface) to create a simple front-end interactive user interfaces. In this case, coding my first weather webmap (interactive map)! However, the primary learning objective emphasizes to retrieve sample codes from an documentation (often available in the API's GitHub website), and lookup relevance resources to problem-solves and troubleshootings.  

In this project, I have chosen the "Intro to Aeris.js beta Weather Map" as my topic. Which I will walkthrough an introductory tutorial to setup a basic weather webmap using JavaScript. 

Pre-requisite: Learners should have an exisiting basics Leaflet.js webmap setup. < http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html >

After my difficulties navigating available resources from documentations (some codes were even outdated and thus no longer work), which were expained in technical manners. I decided to compile a tutorial for the complete beginners that it explains in steps with links only to those info they needed to know.
