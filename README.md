This is an introductory JavaScript learning project @hackeryou.

Project 3 focus on utilizing an API (Application Program Interface) to create a simple front-end interactive user interfaces. In this case, coding my first weather webmap (interactive map)! However, the primary learning objective emphasizes to retrieve sample codes from an documentation (often available in the API's GitHub website), and lookup relevance resources to problem-solves and troubleshootings.  

In this project, I have chosen the "Intro to Aeris.js beta Weather Map" as my topic. Which I will walkthrough an introductory tutorial to setup a basic weather webmap using JavaScript. 

Pre-requisite: 
Learners should have an exisiting basics Leaflet.js webmap setup.

After I had difficulties learning to setup a Aeris.js weather map while looked-up resources from available the official documentations (often very advanced materials posted on GitHub); I decided to compile a much simpler tutorial targeting for the complete beginners whom they likely may encountered similar challenges.
