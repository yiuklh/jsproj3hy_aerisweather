This is an introductory JavaScript, jQuery learning project @hackeryou.

Project 3 focus on developing something that is appropriate to my current beginner proficiency. Yet being creatively challenging to create a simple front-end interactive user interfaces that is doable within the short project timeframe. Perhaps considering an API (Application Program Interface) too! 

Which I programmed my first (ever) weather webmap/interactive online map! The primary objectives emphasize learning how to retrieve sample codes available from an documentation & often in an API's GitHub website, and lookup relevance resources to problem-solves and troubleshootings.  

In this project, I have chosen the "Intro to Aeris.js beta Weather Map" as my topic. Which I will walkthrough an introductory tutorial to setup a basic weather webmap using JavaScript. 

Pre-requisites: 
- Learners should have an exisiting basics Leaflet.js webmap setup. 
< http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html >
- Basic proficiency with JavaScript, HTML, CSS

After my difficulties had while setup a Aeris.js weather map (that's only a basic one to get started!), looked-up resources from available documentations (that are often advanced materials on GitHub or developer websites). I decided to compile a much simpler tutorial targeting for the complete beginners, whom they may also encounter similar learning challenges.
